# KnowledgeBank
This repo tracks the progress of my machine learning and data science self-study. The purpose is to document and organize my knowledge and to collect and share my publications, notes and other resources I deem useful.

### Blog Posts

I'm blogging about machine learning, statistics and other data-related topics. All the articles are available [on my website](https://michaloleszak.github.io/blog/).
