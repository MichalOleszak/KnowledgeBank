I don’t use SQL very often and every time I need it, I find myself googling for the syntax of even the most basic operations. To help myself out, I have put together a cheat sheet of useful queries, all in one place. I hope you will find it useful, too.
The queries are in Postgres, but the patterns are translatable to other SQL flavors. The notes are based on the great DataCamp courses, such as Introduction to SQL, Joining Data in SQL, and Introduction to Relational Databases in SQL, as well as on my own StackOverflow searches. Enjoy!
Key to symbols:
🟠, 🔵, 🟢, etc. denote fields (i.e. variables, or columns)
🗂️ denotes the table name
When there is more than one table in a query, I refer to them as either 🗂️_1, 🗂️_2, etc., or left_🗂️ and right_🗂️, whichever’s more convenient.
ToC:
Creating, altering and removing tables, and filling them with data
Overviewing tables & columns
Selecting columns
Filtering rows
Aggregations, arithmetics, aliasing, sorting & grouping
Inner joins
Cases (long if-else statements)
Left & right joins
Set theory clauses
Full & cross joins
Semi & anti joins
Subqueries
