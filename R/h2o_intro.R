# *** Introductory H2O *** ---- 
# Prepared for H2O Open Chicago 2016: http://open.h2o.ai/chicago.html


# Load the H2O library and start up the H2O cluster locally on your machine
library(h2o)
h2o.init(nthreads = -1, #Number of threads -1 means use all cores on your machine
         max_mem_size = "8G")  #max mem size is the maximum memory to allocate to H2O

# Next we will import a cleaned up version of the Lending Club "Bad Loans" dataset
# The purpose here is to predict whether a loan will be bad (not repaid to the lender)
# The response column, bad_loan, is 1 if the loan was bad, and 0 otherwise

# Import the data
loan_csv <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h2oai/app-consumer-loan/master/data/loan.csv"
data <- h2o.importFile(loan_csv)  # 163,987 rows x 15 columns
dim(data)

# Since we want to train a binary classification model, 
# we must ensure that the response is coded as a factor
# If the response is 0/1, H2O will assume it's numeric,
# which means that H2O will train a regression model instead
data$bad_loan <- as.factor(data$bad_loan) 
h2o.levels(data$bad_loan)  

# Partition the data into training, validation and test sets
splits <- h2o.splitFrame(data = data, 
                         ratios = c(0.7, 0.15), 
                         seed = 1)  
train <- splits[[1]]
valid <- splits[[2]]
test <- splits[[3]]

# Take a look at the size of each partition
# Notice that h2o.splitFrame uses approximate splitting not exact splitting (for efficiency)
# so these are not exactly 70%, 15% and 15% of the total rows
nrow(train)
nrow(valid)
nrow(test) 

# Identify response and predictor variables
y <- "bad_loan"
x <- setdiff(names(data), c(y, "int_rate"))  #remove the interest rate column because it's correlated with the outcome
print(x)

# Now that we have prepared the data, we can train some models
# We will start by training a single model from each of the H2O supervised algos:
# 1. Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
# 2. Random Forest (RF)
# 3. Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
# 4. Deep Learning (DL)
# 5. Naive Bayes (NB)


# 1. Binomial Generalized Linear Model ------------------------------------------------------------
# By default, h2o.glm uses a regularized, elastic net model
glm_fit1 <- h2o.glm(x = x, 
                    y = y, 
                    training_frame = train,
                    model_id = "glm_fit1",
                    family = "binomial")  

# Next we will do some automatic tuning by passing in a validation frame and setting 
# `lambda_search = True`.  Since we are training a GLM with regularization, we should 
# try to find the right amount of regularization (to avoid overfitting).  The model 
# parameter, `lambda`, controls the amount of regularization in a GLM model and we can 
# find the optimal value for `lambda` automatically by setting `lambda_search = TRUE` 
# and passing in a validation frame (which is used to evaluate model performance using a 
# particular value of lambda).
glm_fit2 <- h2o.glm(x = x, 
                    y = y, 
                    training_frame = train,
                    model_id = "glm_fit2",
                    validation_frame = valid,
                    family = "binomial",
                    lambda_search = TRUE)

# Let's compare the performance of the two GLMs
glm_perf1 <- h2o.performance(model = glm_fit1,
                             newdata = test)
glm_perf2 <- h2o.performance(model = glm_fit2,
                             newdata = test)

# Print model performance
glm_perf1
glm_perf2

# Instead of printing the entire model performance metrics object, 
# it is probably easier to print just the metric that you are interested in comparing.
# Retreive test set AUC
h2o.auc(glm_perf1)  
h2o.auc(glm_perf2)  

# Compare test AUC to the training AUC and validation AUC
h2o.auc(glm_fit2, train = TRUE)  
h2o.auc(glm_fit2, valid = TRUE)  
glm_fit2@model$validation_metrics


# 2. Random Forest --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# H2O's Random Forest (RF) implements a distributed version of the standard 
# Random Forest algorithm and variable importance measures.
# First we will train a basic Random Forest model with default parameters. 
# The Random Forest model will infer the response distribution from the response encoding. 
# A seed is required for reproducibility.
rf_fit1 <- h2o.randomForest(x = x,
                            y = y,
                            training_frame = train,
                            model_id = "rf_fit1",
                            seed = 1)

# Next we will increase the number of trees used in the forest by setting `ntrees = 100`.  
# The default number of trees in an H2O Random Forest is 50, so this RF will be twice as 
# big as the default.  Usually increasing the number of trees in a RF will increase 
# performance as well.  Unlike Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs), Random Forests are fairly 
# resistant (although not free from) overfitting.
# See the GBM example below for additional guidance on preventing overfitting using H2O's 
# early stopping functionality.
rf_fit2 <- h2o.randomForest(x = x,
                            y = y,
                            training_frame = train,
                            model_id = "rf_fit2",
                            #validation_frame = valid,  #only used if stopping_rounds > 0
                            ntrees = 100,
                            seed = 1)

# Let's compare the performance of the two RFs
rf_perf1 <- h2o.performance(model = rf_fit1,
                            newdata = test)
rf_perf2 <- h2o.performance(model = rf_fit2,
                            newdata = test)

# Print model performance
rf_perf1
rf_perf2

# Retreive test set AUC
h2o.auc(rf_perf1)
h2o.auc(rf_perf2)

# Cross-validate performance ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rather than using held-out test set to evaluate model performance, a user may wish 
# to estimate model performance using cross-validation. Using the RF algorithm 
# (with default model parameters) as an example, we demonstrate how to perform k-fold 
# cross-validation using H2O. No custom code or loops are required, you simply specify 
# the number of desired folds in the nfolds argument.
# Since we are not going to use a test set here, we can use the original (full) dataset, 
# which we called data rather than the subsampled `train` dataset. Note that this will 
# take approximately k (nfolds) times longer than training a single RF model, since it 
# will train k models in the cross-validation process (trained on n(k-1)/k rows), in 
# addition to the final model trained on the full training_frame dataset with n rows.
rf_fit3 <- h2o.randomForest(x = x,
                            y = y,
                            training_frame = train,
                            model_id = "rf_fit3",
                            seed = 1,
                            nfolds = 5)

# To evaluate the cross-validated AUC, do the following:
h2o.auc(rf_fit3, xval = TRUE) 


# 3. Gradient Boosting Machine --------------------------------------------------------------------
# H2O's Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) offers a Stochastic GBM, which can 
# increase performance quite a bit compared to the original GBM implementation.

# Now we will train a basic GBM model
# The GBM model will infer the response distribution from the response encoding if not specified 
# explicitly through the `distribution` argument. A seed is required for reproducibility.
gbm_fit1 <- h2o.gbm(x = x,
                    y = y,
                    training_frame = train,
                    model_id = "gbm_fit1",
                    seed = 1)

# Next we will increase the number of trees used in the GBM by setting `ntrees=500`.  
# The default number of trees in an H2O GBM is 50, so this GBM will trained using ten times 
# the default.  Increasing the number of trees in a GBM is one way to increase performance 
# of the model, however, you have to be careful not to overfit your model to the training data 
# by using too many trees.  To automatically find the optimal number of trees, you must use 
# H2O's early stopping functionality.  This example will not do that, however, the following 
# example will.
gbm_fit2 <- h2o.gbm(x = x,
                    y = y,
                    training_frame = train,
                    model_id = "gbm_fit2",
                    #validation_frame = valid,  #only used if stopping_rounds > 0
                    ntrees = 500,
                    seed = 1)

# We will again set `ntrees = 500`, however, this time we will use early stopping in order to 
# prevent overfitting (from too many trees).  All of H2O's algorithms have early stopping available, 
# however early stopping is not enabled by default (with the exception of Deep Learning).  
# There are several parameters that should be used to control early stopping.  The three that are 
# common to all the algorithms are: `stopping_rounds`, `stopping_metric` and `stopping_tolerance`.  
# The stopping metric is the metric by which you'd like to measure performance, and so we will choose 
# AUC here.  The `score_tree_interval` is a parameter specific to the Random Forest model and the GBM.  
# Setting `score_tree_interval = 5` will score the model after every five trees.  The parameters we 
# have set below specify that the model will stop training after there have been three scoring intervals 
# where the AUC has not increased more than 0.0005.  Since we have specified a validation frame, 
# the stopping tolerance will be computed on validation AUC rather than training AUC. 
gbm_fit3 <- h2o.gbm(x = x,
                    y = y,
                    training_frame = train,
                    model_id = "gbm_fit3",
                    validation_frame = valid,  #only used if stopping_rounds > 0
                    ntrees = 500,
                    score_tree_interval = 5,      #used for early stopping
                    stopping_rounds = 3,          #used for early stopping

                    stopping_tolerance = 0.0005,  #used for early stopping
                    seed = 1)

# Let's compare the performance of the two GBMs
gbm_perf1 <- h2o.performance(model = gbm_fit1,
                             newdata = test)
gbm_perf2 <- h2o.performance(model = gbm_fit2,
                             newdata = test)

h2o.auc(gbm_perf2)  
h2o.auc(gbm_perf3)  

# To examine the scoring history, use the `scoring_history` method on a trained model.  
# If `score_tree_interval` is not specified, it will score at various intervals, as we can 
# see for `h2o.scoreHistory()` below.  However, regular 5-tree intervals are used 
# for `h2o.scoreHistory()`.  
# The `gbm_fit2` was trained only using a training set (no validation set), so the scoring 
# history is calculated for training set performance metrics only.
h2o.scoreHistory(gbm_fit2)


# When early stopping is used, we see that training stopped at 105 trees instead of the full 500.  
# Since we used a validation set in `gbm_fit3`, both training and validation performance metrics 
# are stored in the scoring history object. Take a look at the validation AUC to observe that the 
# correct stopping tolerance was enforced.
h2o.scoreHistory(gbm_fit3)

# Plot parameters training ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     metric = "logloss")


# 4. Deep Learning --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# H2O's Deep Learning algorithm is a multilayer feed-forward artificial neural network.  
# It can also be used to train an autoencoder. In this example we will train 
# a standard supervised prediction model.

# Train a default DL
# First we will train a basic DL model with default parameters. The DL model will infer the response 
# distribution from the response encoding if it is not specified explicitly through the `distribution` 
# argument.  H2O's DL will not be reproducible if it is run on more than a single core, so in this 
# example, the performance metrics below may vary slightly from what you see on your machine.
# In H2O's DL, early stopping is enabled by default, so below, it will use the training set and 
# default stopping parameters to perform early stopping.
dl_fit1 <- h2o.deeplearning(x = x,
                            y = y,
                            training_frame = train,
                            model_id = "dl_fit1",
                            seed = 1)

# Train a DL with new architecture and more epochs.
# Next we will increase the number of epochs used in the GBM by setting `epochs=20` (the default is 10).  
# Increasing the number of epochs in a deep neural net may increase performance of the model, however, 
# you have to be careful not to overfit your model to your training data.  To automatically find the 
# optimal number of epochs, you must use H2O's early stopping functionality.  Unlike the rest of the H2O 
# algorithms, H2O's DL will use early stopping by default, so for comparison we will first turn off early 
# stopping.  We do this in the next example by setting `stopping_rounds=0`.
dl_fit2 <- h2o.deeplearning(x = x,

                            stopping_rounds = 0,  # disable early stopping
                            seed = 1)

# Train a DL with early stopping
# This example will use the same model parameters as `dl_fit2`. This time, we will turn on 
# early stopping and specify the stopping criterion.  We will also pass a validation set, as is
# recommended for early stopping.
dl_fit3 <- h2o.deeplearning(x = x,
                            y = y,

# 5. Naive Bayes model ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm does not usually beat an algorithm like a Random Forest 
# or GBM, however it is still a popular algorithm, especially in the text domain (when your 
# input is text encoded as "Bag of Words", for example).  The Naive Bayes algorithm is for 
# binary or multiclass classification problems only, not regression.  Therefore, your response 
# must be a factor instead of a numeric.

# First we will train a basic NB model with default parameters.

                          model_id = "nb_fit1")

# Train a NB model with Laplace Smoothing
# One of the few tunable model parameters for the Naive Bayes algorithm is the amount of Laplace 
# smoothing. The H2O Naive Bayes model will not use any Laplace smoothing by default.
nb_fit2 <- h2o.naiveBayes(x = x,
